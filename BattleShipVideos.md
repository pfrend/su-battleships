> I've recently spent some time to look for iPhone/Android games.I am pretty much convinced that BattleShip is a good choice for the Android Game project. All the good games that i've seen (and that is more than 50) in internet eather had a lot of 3D graphics or did not have interesting scenario.


> The BattleShips game is not necessary to support 3D-videos, but if there is time and opportunity,in the First video a nice 3D-Video Feature can be observed and possibly added in the project functionality.

> Another additional feature can be the "Superweapons" mode,that can be seen as a part of the menu right in the beginning of the First video.

> If those feature are to be added to the project ,I suggest the following User Stories:




1)Superweapons User Stories:

As a User I can choose to start new battleship game in "Superweapons" mode, so I can play different type of game.

As a User I can use different types of weapons to attack the opponent's ships, so that the game can have various ways of playing. (**)**

As an AI I can use different attack algorithms for the different kinds of weapons, so I can shoot Userâ€™s ships. (**)**




2)3D-Videos User Stories:

As a User I can observe a 3D-Video for a couple of seconds after each shot, so that I can enjoy the game's cool graphics.

As a User I can suddenly stop the 3D-Video and return to the game screen, so that I can play the game faster.
